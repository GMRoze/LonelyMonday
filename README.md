# Lonely Monday ☕

Despite the popularization of technology and the increasing access to publishing (Medium, WordPress, etc...), there is a significant gap in _folk publishing_ (don't worry, we'll define it). Like John Lomax, who traveled the USA collecting folk ballads and tales, or Krišjānis Barons who collected the Dainas, Lonely Monday is a humble project that seeks to create a community-driven way to collect and discuss themes surrounding art, literature, and philosophy.

What did we call it _folk publishing_? Well, we're not trying to create any new movement, but simply describe a more independent and community-focused type of publishing. The word folk means people, and as an adjective, it describes the "traditional or typical (customs and arts) of a particular community or nation."¹

According to Dominica Ramírez and David Dorrell²:  "Folk customs originate in the distant past and change slowly over time. Folk cultures move across space by relocation diffusion, as groups move they bring their cultural items, as well as their ideas with them." Furthermore, since folk is tied to a community or nation, it differs from place to place, therefore, it is "stable through time, but highly variable across space."

Like locally produced foods or vernacular architecture, we seek to collect high-quality, original content surrounding literature, arts, and philosophy with a down-to-earth and humble approach

Our closes inspiration is [Deep Baltic](https://deepbaltic.com/), a free-to-read website containing hundreds of hearty articles ranging from "detailed analysis of the Latvian National Communists of the 1950s" to "appreciation of the wonders of Lithuanian birch juice", all written with heart by local experts. Our goal is not to focus on a specific region as the Baltics but rather general themes of life in the 21st Century - or rather - the discussions one could find himself having drinking coffee alone on a lonely, rainy Monday (ergo, the name and the visual identity).

We host the project on Github because of the platform's historical openness to community discussions and its historical commitment to open-source and libre software. If our discussions are to be relevant for the tech age, we must strive to find the creative balance between technology and art. For this reason, we also invite experts to experiment with AI and art, especially literature and NLP (Natural Language Processing).

<!-- **A small introduction:**

Few things in nature are more uniquely human than Language - or at least, language as we know it: First, it is a fairly recent creation (roughly _150.000_ years ago, while the _homo sapiens_ exists for at least _300.000_ ), and secondly, one almost destined to die with humanity, as Artificial Intelligence has few uses for something impractical and ambiguous like it.

Impractical in the sense that while our ancestors and machines could both use a single signal (either a scream or a bit) to identify danger, modern humans need a few words to indicate it, a few more to question the true existence and extent of it, and some extra more to confirm. The world Lonely can be used, for example, to describe both a person whose sole companion on Monday is his coffee and the musings of his mind - or the current state of humanity, drifting in space alone in an empty cosmos.

And ambiguous in the sense that the words lonely and solitude, for example, can be used interchangeably. Yet, not all who are in solitude feel lonely - on the other hand, many who are in companionship feel lonely. 

**Ok, so what?**

So there we stand, in this brief gap between the invention of language and its disuse. And for something so mundane in our day, rarely is the reflection on its use incentivized on a popular level. The Academia, specially the circles of Linguistics in universities,  - while having a very important role - can often fall in highbrow or even pretentious discussions.
